    takes in two parents and their respective fitness, and outputs child using innovation number matching as in the NEAT paper.

    See the below NEAT paper extracts:

    "[using innovation numbers] the system now
    knows exactly which genes match up with which (Figure 4). When crossing over, the
    genes in both genomes with the same innovation numbers are lined up. These genes
    are called matching genes. Genes that do not match are either disjoint or excess, depend-
    ing on whether they occur within or outside the range of the other parentâ€™s innovation
    numbers."

    "In composing the offspring, genes are randomly chosen from either parent at matching genes,
    whereas all excess or disjoint genes are always included from the more fit parent."

    "There was a 75% chance that an inherited gene was disabled if it was disabled
    in either parent."
