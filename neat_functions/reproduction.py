'''
class which takes in "fully filled" genome_collection (i.e. each genome_descriptor is fully described with genome,fitness and adjusted_fitness!)
and creates a NEW genome_collection full of its offspring according to NEAT reproduction rules.

"Every species is
assigned a potentially different number of offspring in proportion to the sum of ad-
justed fitnesses f â€²i of its member organisms. Species then reproduce by first eliminating
the lowest performing members from the population. The entire population is then
replaced by the offspring of the remaining organisms in each species."

So first:

order the genomes by their adjusted fitness within each species
remove a percentage of the lowest performers.

Block into smaller chunks of code and check!

Then onto mutation and keeping track of mutations that have happened in the same generation.

Then... thats it! Try* the XOR validation.
